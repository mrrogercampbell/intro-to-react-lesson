# Dev Tools:
## Git Bash on Windows
"Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience." - Atlassian.com

In laymen terms `Git Bash` is a terminal application that Windows users can utilize in place of the `Command Prompt` terminal that comes as default with all Windows OS. `Git Bash` in turn allows you to use `Git` command in the terminal.

Utilizing `Git Bash` is very helpful when you are working with `React` and other frameworks that run hefty size servers in local development.

Moral of the story: Utilize `Git Bash` to run your `React` server instead of the build in terminal in your text editor.

### How to Run Git Bash on Windows
1. Press the Windows button on your keyboard
2. Type `Git Bash`
3. Select the program
